# x-tagger
x-tagger is a Natural Language Processing toolkit for token classification in its simplest form.

x-tagger allows you to play with all kind of data: pandas dataframe, nltk tagged corpus, text, torchtext iterator.

x-tagger supports only Hidden Markov Model with its extensions (viterbi decoding, bigram, trigram, delete interpolation), Long Short-Term Memory with its extensions (unidirectional, bidirectional), BERT; for now.

Upcoming features: Bidirectional HMMs, morphological way to dealing with unkown words in HMMs, Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM), prior regex tagger.
