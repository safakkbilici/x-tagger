</p>

x-tagger is a Natural Language Processing toolkit for token classification in its simplest form.

* It allows you to play with all kind of data: pandas dataframe, nltk tagged corpus, .txt, torchtext iterator and ðŸ¤— datasets.

* Supports only Hidden Markov Model with its extensions (viterbi decoding, bigram, trigram, delete interpolation), Long Short-Term Memory with its extensions (unidirectional, bidirectional), BERT; for now.

* There are upcoming features soon:
  * Bidirectional Hidden Markov Models.
  * <s>Morphological way to dealing with unkown words (language dependent)</s>.
  * Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM).
  * <s>Prior RegEx tagger for computational efficiency in HMMs (language dependent)</s>.
  * Beam search.
  * <s>Different metrics</s>.
  * LSTM-CNN, LSTM-CRF
  * <s>more metrics for LSTM\-\*</s>.
  * <s>saving and loading models with metric monitoring</s>.
  * <s> Wrapper for PyTorch sequence labeling models</s>.
  * Wrapper for PyTorch models in general.

Remainder: x-tagger is currently in beta release and one-person project.
